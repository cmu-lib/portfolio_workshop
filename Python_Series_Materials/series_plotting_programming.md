# Series - Plotting and Programming with Python

Welcome to this introductory workshop series on Python for data science. This is a three part 
series that will walk through basic Python programming with data, working in Jupyter Lab, and doing 
advanced analyses with tabular datasets. See the schedule or table of contents below to navigate 
through all the workshop material.

## Part 1: Introduction to Basic Programming with Data

In this workshop series, we offer an introduction to Python for non-programmers with a focus on data analysis. In this workshop, 
we will demonstrate how to do basic Python programming in Jupyter Notebooks. Topics will include working with different data types 
and using built-in functions and libraries to read and manipulate data.  

## Part 2: Plotting and Analyzing Tabular Datasets

In the second part of the workshop series, we demonstrate beginner Python programming techniques using the Pandas library to read 
tabular datasets, perform simple analyses, and visualize data. 

## Part 3: Analyzing Data with Logic and Iteration

In the final part of the workshop series, we offer an overview of Python fundamentals for performing iterative tasks with for 
loops and conditional tasks using logic and if statements. We will then show how to apply these programming techniques to analyze 
and visualize multiple tabular datasets with Pandas.
