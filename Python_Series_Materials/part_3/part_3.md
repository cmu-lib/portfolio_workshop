# Part 3: Analyzing Data with Logic and Iteration

In the final part of the 3-part workshop series, "Introduction to Python for Data Science," we offer an overview of Python fundamentals for performing iterative tasks with for loops and conditional tasks using logic and if statements.
We will then show how to apply these programming techniques to analyze and visualize multiple tabular datasets with Pandas. 
The content covered in this workshop will be a continuation of the content covered in part 1, "Introduction to Basic Programming with Data" and part 2, "Plotting and Analyzing Tabular Datasets".
We highly encourage attending both part 1 and 2 of the series before this workshop, especially for learners that are new to the Python programming language.

### Learning Objectives

Workshop attendees will be able to:

1. Store multiple values in Python with lists   
2. Make Python programs do iterative tasks   
3. Write programs that do tasks conditionally   
4. Process many data sets with a single command
